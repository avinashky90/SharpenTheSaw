Preemptive scheduling is one which can be done in the circumstances when a process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state. Here, the resources (CPU cycles) are allocated to the process for the limited amount of time and then is taken away, and the process is placed back in the ready queue again if it still has CPU burst time remaining.
